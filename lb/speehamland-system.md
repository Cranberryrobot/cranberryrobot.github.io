# The Speehamland System 1795

## The System
This was a kind of __poor relief__ aimed at resolving the problems created by poor harvests in 1789, 1790, 1792 - 1795. Many people fell into famine due to the inability to purchase bread (or other food) because of the high prices and lack of avaliablity.

W.E. Minchinton states that wheat prices increased hugely between 1792 and 1795.

|Year|price of wheat|
|----|---------------|
|1792| 43s (£2/3/-)|
|1793|49s, 3d (£2/6/3)|
|1794|52s, 3d (£2/12/3)|
|1795|108s, 4d (£5/8/4)|

### The 1601 Elizabethan Poor Law

### 1601 System
The Elizabethan poor law dealt with those who couldn't work (those with diabilities, sick, elderly etc) but also dealt with others who were not in work. The latter group was generally punished for being unemployed as it was believed that these people "wouldn't" work. The Law worked on a parish level, so the extent and nature of relief varied widely.

Some parishes were more sympathetic to the poor whereas other parishes were not so much. 

### 1662 Settlement Act

This meant that relief could only be given at a person's place of "settlement". This ensured that there would not be poor people getting assistance in another parish with more generous relief. 

Settlement could be proved in three ways:
1. You were born in a particular parish.
2. You were married in a particular parish. (WOMEN ONLY)
3. You had worked in the parish for a year and a day (366 days). 
    _This did not entirely work, as many contracts became short - so for 364 days or 51 weeks._
