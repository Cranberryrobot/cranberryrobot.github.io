# The Speehamland System 1795

## The System
This was a kind of __poor relief__ aimed at resolving the problems created by poor harvests in 1789, 1790, 1792 - 1795. Many people fell into famine due to the inability to purchase bread (or other food) because of the high prices and lack of avaliablity.

W.E. Minchinton states that wheat prices increased hugely between 1792 and 1795.

|Year|price of wheat|
|----|---------------|
|1792| 43s (£2/3/-)|
|1793|49s, 3d (£2/6/3)|
|1794|52s, 3d (£2/12/3)|
|1795|108s, 4d (£5/8/4)|

### The 1601 Elizabethan Poor Law

The Elizabethan poor law dealt with those who couldn't work (those with diabilities, sick, elderly etc) but also dealt with others who were not in work. The latter group was generally punished for being unemployed as it was believed that these people "wouldn't" work.
